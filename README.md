# Book Recommendation Engine using KNN

## Project Overview
This project is a Book Recommendation Engine implemented in Python, utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The engine analyzes user ratings to recommend similar books based on the title provided. The model is designed to filter out less popular books and users with fewer ratings, ensuring that the recommendations are relevant and reliable. The primary aim is to demonstrate the application of machine learning in creating personalized book suggestions.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for implementing the recommendation algorithm.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and array manipulations.
Pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis, specifically for handling the book and ratings datasets.
SciPy: Employed for the implementation of the KNN algorithm via the NearestNeighbors class.
Matplotlib: Although not used in the current code, it's available for data visualization if needed.
